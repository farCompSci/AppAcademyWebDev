    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a brief html challenge to practice using html elements.
        We will also look at what the tags refer to. For example, the 
        <em>`p`</em> tags will take in paragraphs.

    <h2>What are Headings</h2>
    <p>
        Headings are emphasized texts placed in the tage <em>`h1`</em> up to <em>`h6`</em>.
        The higher the number, the smaller the text and the less it should
        be emphasized.

    <h2>What are paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        Paragraphs are bodies of texts, placed in the `p` tag, as mentioned 
        previously. It can be used to store larger bodies of text will less 
        emphasis than headers.

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p> A list is pretty explanatory. There are two types: unordered and 
        ordered. Ordered lists use the tag `ol` and unordered lists use 
        the tag `ul`.
    </p>
    <ol>Ordered List Examples</ol>
        <li>First Element</li>
        <li>Second Element</li>
        <li>Third Element</li>
    <ul>Unordered List Example</ul>
        <li>First Element
        <li>Second Element</li>
        <li>Third Element</li>

    <h2>Anchor Tags</h2>
    <p> Anchor Tags are used to envelop text and direct the user to a link 
        whenever the link is pressed. It uses the tag `a` and has the attribute
        `href`, in which the link directing the user will be stored. Here is an example
        <br>
        <a href="#top-of-page">Top of index.html.</a>
        <a href="duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Search Engine.</a>
